AI for Builders

One-liner
Foundations course on building with LLMs and using vibe coding tools – made for non-technical professionals who want to build AI products. 

What it is
A 5-week online course that consists of:

20% AI Fundamentals >> understand the vocabulary and concepts behind LLMs
80% Building with LLMs >> get exposure to vibe coding tools, learn how to integrate AI to products, practice prompting, and ship.

This 2nd part includes:

setting up your tech stack (think VS Code, GitHub)
using Claude Code to prototype ideas
learning about LLM APIs and how you can integrate them into your projects (think chat assistants and agents)
completing three sprints using tools like Claude Code, n8n, Instant, and Supabase so you get further exposure to tools and build approaches
By the end of the course, you’ll build a working AI-powered web app from scratch and walk away with a foundational toolbox of vibe coding tools and approaches that you can apply immediately and grow over time.

Who it’s for
We built this for non-technical founders, PMs and other tech-adjacent professionals in tech (marketing, ops, product design, etc.) who:

want to meet the growing expectation to prototype ideas themselves using vibe coding (see Aaron Levie's and Kaz Nejatian's twitter threads)
feel the itch to build but don’t know where to begin
already tried tools like Lovable but got frustrated and want to have more control over their product
aren’t scared to learn something hard!

How it works
small study group of 7-12 founders/PMs/marketing/ops ppl
structured, well-researched curriculum, updated as of Oct 2025
hands-on instructor, who comes from a non-technical background and has mastered vibe coding herself
weekly speakers like: Gordon Wintrob (co-founder and CTO of Newfront, $2.2bn insurance tech co), Vaibhav Gupta (co-founder of Boundary YC W23, ex-Google, ex-Microsoft)
SOTA learning practices like active recall, spaced repetition, metacognition, etc.
async reading & assignments, mixed with group calls to keep you accountable
three sprints integrated within the course
course project you launch on your final week

Outcomes
This is not a "10 easy lessons to code" gimmick. We don’t sell shortcuts; our approach is to go deeper and resist the easy path. You will get frustrated. You will get familiar with the terminal.

But on the other side, you will walk away with:

a compounding toolbox of skills like setting up and using Claude Code, calling LLM APIs, building automations with n8n, and debugging in the terminal
a launched prototype like a working AI-powered web app you can demo, share, and use as proof of execution
a repeatable methodology -- you will learn a structured approach to starting projects, unblocking yourself with Claude Code and ChatGPT, and shipping prototypes regardless of the problem or scope

Syllabus
w1, AI Fundamentals: develop a theoretical foundation of Large Language Models and AI use cases
w2, Vibe Coding Foundations + Sprint 1: set up your dev environment and build your first web app
w3, Deep Dive with Claude Code + Sprint 2: get a foundational understanding of AI-powered development with Claude Code by building a chat assistant from scratch
w4, Automation & Agents + Sprint 3: learn about augmenting LLMs; build an Insights Generator Agent using n8n
w5, Evals & Demo Your Final Project: get a topline understanding of evals, demo your prototype & ship!

Why Claude Code
Three big reasons, and many little ones:

it forces you into the craft by teaching you programming concepts -- you'll have to go deeper into your build approach, UX/UI, databases, and APIs
it gives you finer control over your product compared to tools like Lovable
if you can learn how to use Claude Code, all the other vibe coding tools are easier to learn

Logistics
fully remote
5 weeks, ~1-2h a day to make sure it really sinks in and make progress on projects
70% async (reading, watching, vibe coding, etc.) and 30% live (speaker lectures, group discussions)
live lectures and group calls are on Thursdays and Fridays at 9 am PT
Important! You really need to allocate at least ~1-2hr per day to the course, otherwise it won’t work. Karpathy explains why in this twitter thread.
